- Hi! I'm Zoie Rast!

- I'm currently a 4th year (Senior) at Clemson University (Go Tigers)!
- I am majoring in a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.

- I love C/C++, and it has to be my favorite language, but I know many others.....
  Like Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, SQL/PLSQL, Python, and I am still learning.
 
- I'm always open to meeting new programmers and learning about the industry!
- I also have just finished a CO-OP at BMW Plant Spartanburg!
